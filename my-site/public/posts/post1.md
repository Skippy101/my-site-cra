# Understanding Flexbox in CSS

Flexbox is a powerful layout module in CSS that helps us design complex layouts without using floats or positioning hacks. It is particularly well suited for creating responsive web designs.

## Key Concepts

Here are some key concepts of Flexbox:

- **Flex Container**: The parent element, which is assigned the `display: flex` property.
- **Flex Items**: The direct children of a flex container, which can be manipulated to create flexible layouts.
- **Main Axis**: The primary axis along which flex items are placed. It can be horizontal or vertical, depending on the `flex-direction` property.

### Example Code

 This blog post contains:

1. **Front Matter (YAML)**: The metadata at the top, including `title`, `date`, `author`, and `tags`. These can be parsed and displayed in the UI.
2. **Markdown Content**: The body of the post, formatted with headings, text, lists, and code snippets, using Markdown syntax.

### How It Will Render:
- The blog title (`Understanding Flexbox in CSS`) will be rendered as a `h1` tag.
- Subtitles like "Key Concepts" and "Benefits of Flexbox" will be `h2` tags.
- Inline code snippets are wrapped in backticks, and block code uses triple backticks (```).
- The front matter can be used in the React component to display metadata like the post's title, author, and tags in your blog UI.

Make sure to handle the parsing of the front matter separately if you want to use that information in your blog post component. For example, you could use a library like `gray-matter` to extract it:
